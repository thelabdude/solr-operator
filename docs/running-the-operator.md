# Running the Solr Operator

### Installing the Zookeeper Operator

Before installing the Solr Operator, we need to install the [Zookeeper Operator](https://github.com/pravega/zookeeper-operator).
This is because the Solr Operator, in most instances, relies on the Zookeeper Operator to create the Zookeeper clusters that Solr coordinates through.
Eventually this will be a dependency on the helm chart, but for now we can run an easy `kubectl apply`.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bloomberg/solr-operator/master/example/dependencies/zk_operator.yaml
```

## Using the Solr Operator Helm Chart

The easiest way to run the Solr Operator is via the [provided Helm Chart](https://hub.helm.sh/charts/solr-operator/solr-operator).

The helm chart provides abstractions over the Input Arguments described below, and should work with any official images in docker hub.

### How to install via Helm

The first step is to add the Solr Operator helm repository.

```bash
$ helm repo add solr-operator https://bloomberg.github.io/solr-operator/charts
```


Next, install the Solr Operator chart. Note this is using Helm v3, in order to use Helm v2 please consult the [Helm Chart documentation](https://hub.helm.sh/charts/solr-operator/solr-operator).

```bash
$ helm install solr-operator solr-operator/solr-operator
```

After installing, you can check to see what lives in the cluster to make sure that the Solr and ZooKeeper operators have started correctly.
```
$ kubectl get all

NAME                                       READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE

deployment.apps/zk-operator                1/1     1            1           49d

NAME                                       DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/solr-operator-8449d4d96f   1         1         1       2d1h
replicaset.apps/zk-operator-674676769c     1         1         1       49d
```

After inspecting the status of you Kube cluster, you should see a deployment for the Solr Operator as well as the Zookeeper Operator.

## Solr Operator Docker Images

Two Docker images are published to [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/bloomberg/solr-operator), both based off of the same base image.

- [Builder Image](build/Dockerfile.build) - Downloads gomod dependencies, builds operator executable (This is not published, only used to build the following images)
- [Slim Image](build/Dockerfile.slim) - Contains only the operator executable, with the operator as the entry point
- [Vendor Image](build/Dockerfile.slim) - Contains the operator executable as well as all dependencies (at `/solr-operator-vendor-sources`)

In order to run the Solr Operator, you will only need the Slim Image.

## Solr Operator Input Args

* **-zookeeper-operator** Whether or not to use the Zookeeper Operator to create dependent Zookeeepers.
                          Required to use the `ProvidedZookeeper.Zookeeper` option within the Spec.
                          If _true_, then a Zookeeper Operator must be running for the cluster.
                          ( _true_ | _false_ , defaults to _false_)
* **-ingress-base-domain** If you desire to make solr externally addressable via ingresses, a base ingress domain is required.
                        Solr Clouds will be created with ingress rules at `*.(ingress-base-domain)`.
                        ( _optional_ , e.g. `ing.base.domain` )
